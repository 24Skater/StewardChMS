/**
 * Single sign-on.
 *
 * One identity provider across the Steward applications, so somebody who serves
 * at a church using Congregation and Table signs in once rather than twice.
 *
 * **Vendored, not imported.** The same rules live in the console, in Table and
 * in VBS. That is deliberate: this repository must stay installable by a church
 * that has never heard of the hosted platform, and a shared package would make
 * its install depend on a registry somebody else controls. When a rule changes,
 * change it in the console and port it here.
 *
 * **It is one more way in, never a replacement.** Email and password keeps
 * working. With no `AUTH0_ISSUER` the SSO routes answer 404 and nothing else in
 * this codebase behaves differently.
 *
 * **It never creates a person.** Congregation memberships are granted by an
 * administrator, so signing in through the identity provider finds an account
 * that already exists and belongs to this church, or it fails. A federated
 * identity is not an invitation.
 *
 * **Linking requires a verified email.** An identity provider will happily
 * issue an identity for an unverified address. Linking on one turns "I can
 * claim any email" into "I can take over the account that owns it" — so the
 * verification check is the whole of the security argument for letting an SSO
 * sign-in land on an account that already exists.
